## Idea Proposal
1. What is/are the problem/s you want to solve? Why is it important?
<p>Executive functioning skills are extremely important for functioning in day to day life. This app aims to assist people who lack such skills to build them in order to lead a more organized life.</p>

2. Who are the users you are targeting?
<p>Our target users are people who lack executive functioning skills, be it people with executive functinoing disorders such as ADHD, or neurotypical people who simply never learned such skills.</p>

3. How will this app solve the tackled problem/s? Provide a vision statement.
<p>The app aims to help people with executive functioning by helping them to create a routine, and more importantly, sustain a routine. It will do this using context dependent reminder systems which can assist the user with various types of organization.</p>

4. What are the major features of the app?
<p>The app will have a reminder system to remind the user to do things such as entering their assignemnts into the app after they have classes. It will also be able to allow the user to break their longer term tasks down into more digestable pieces which they will be able to schedule.</p>

5. What similar apps exist on the market?

* [Google Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/) - Simple Calendar app that comes with all android phones. This app is functional as a basic calendar with alarms and simple reminders. The app has some very convenient features such as gmail integration in order to schedule things. Since this app comes with all android phones, it is not aimed at any specific user, and as such does not have the type of support systems we aim to implement.

* [Todoist](https://todoist.com/) - To do app with robust features for breaking down tasks and task organization. The app has the types of features that we would want to implement in terms of keeping track of tasks. The app does not assist the user in terms of implementing this system into their life though. For people with good executive functioning skills this is not an issue, but for our target users it would be challenging to use this.

* [Fabulous: Daily Routine Planner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=co.thefabulous.app&hl=en_US&gl=US) - Planner app with a focus on behavioral science. When using this app to research for our app, we found the app to be a bit overwhelming. The app has a lot of features and does not explain how to use most of them to the user. Our app aims to be a more guided experience to avoid the user becoming overwhelmed and consequently never wanting to use the app.

* [Routinery: Ritual/ Routine](https://routinery.app/) - Routine focused daily planner app which aims to help the user create routine in their daily life. Once again this app has some features we would like to implement, specifically their clever use of timers in order to help the user contain their tasks within set time periods. Similar to all the other apps, we don't think this app does enough for our target audience. Specifically it lacks some of the features in terms of breaking down tasks.

* [School Planner](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=daldev.android.gradehelper) - Planner app aimed specifically at students. It has a lot of great features in terms of visualizing tasks for students. The feature where you can put your teacher or professor's contact information into the app is also great, since it removes a barrier for the user to contact them in case they have to. In addition the app has great features in terms of reminding the student about their assignments and classes. The problem with this app is that the setup process does not go in depth enough for our users and trusts the user to create entries without any assistance. Our app will aim to assist the user throughout the whole setup process, and continually remind them to keep track of their assigments.

6. How is your app unique?
<p>After looking at the apps which are similar to ours a patten emerges. Lots of apps do some things which are helpful for people who lack executive functioning skills, but in our opinion, none of them provide a full package aimed directly at their use case. We aim to fix that by creating an app tailor made for those users.</p>

7. What are the risks associated with the development of this app? Why wouldnâ€™t it be delivered completely (scope), on time and on budget? Identify 3 to 5 risks that are relevant in your case.
<p>The biggest risk associated with making this app is simply the scope of the app. What we aim to do is very ambitious within the time frame we have. We could run into issues in terms of implementing APIs we need for the planner. We could also simply have trouble implementing some of our ideas into functional features in the app.</p>

8. What is your goal with this project?
<p>Our goals for this project are to gain experience in mobile development and build the beginnings of an app which we will be able to continuously develop after this semester in order to actually release it.</p>
